GGMLDebug {tensor_name} {count}

Inserts a ggml tensor debug block which can be useful when debugging
graph computations in ggml/llama.cpp. A good place to uses this is in
llama.cpp in llama-context.cpp in process_ubatch after the graph has
been computed.

One thing to keep in mind is that tensor can be reused by the scheduler
in ggml so it might be required to set the tensor as output to pervent
this:
ggml_set_output(tensor);

Example:

    :GGMLDebug top_p_mask 100
